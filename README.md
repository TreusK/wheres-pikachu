This Odin challenge was about creating a Where's Waldo and keeping the state of scores in a BAAS like Firebase.
Other than that I added difficulty levels and a Random option, which picks 3 pokemon from the coordinates object and fetches
the sprites from Pokeapi.

Made with
```
>React
>React-Router
>Bulma.css
>Firebase (hosting and cloud storage)
```
